## Week 6 Assignment

This week, I learned how to embed videos and am finishing up grasping html coding. Embedding videos is pretty simple, especially when getting them from youtube.

The website I created is pretty nifty for how much I have learned from html. I still ran into problems with photos (one in particular) on my submit your videos section of my site. I didn't run into any problems with the others and I can't seem to find out why that is. I have definitely gotten better since the last assignment thanks to my professors words of advice about the matter.
