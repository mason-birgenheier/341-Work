1. For this week of class, I learned how to manipulate the intensity
of font and making lists. I am getting more comfortable with how to
create decent looking lists with headers and bullet points.

2. When it comes to the homework, you have to really focus on what you're
doing. I tweaked something and now I don't know how to make my text
not bold.

3. I thought my website turned how pretty good. This course is a challenge,
but I think this class is teaching us a valuable tool for the future and
continuation of the internet.

4. I want to keep learning more and see if I can challenge myself
to get better every week consistently.
