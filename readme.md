# Week 8
## CSS & HTML

I was having a really hard time conencting my css package onto my hmtl document,
Font styling was also an issue for me, but I did the best i could.

I wasn't too picky on the design of my website... Making the Css was fun,
but it doesn't seem to be mapping properly...

Overall, It was interesting to learn that applyung css styling to your website
and how it can really enhance the look and feel of the website. I've used dreamweaver,
but understanding how to build it more from scratch has been intersting and trying.
