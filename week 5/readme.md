<br>
<p>For this week's assignment, I learned how to make questionnaires and incorporate images into a web page.</p>
<br>
<p>It was pretty cool how to learn about the different elements that can diversify webpages and make them more interesting and interactive. </p>
<br>
<p>I did notice that on my webpage for this week, my images aren't appearing. I don't know how to get around it even after applying the src. and destination.
