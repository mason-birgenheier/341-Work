# Mason Birgenheier
## Web Design Class


So, this week I was introduced to a whole new world programs that I have never tried before. Those programs include:

-git
-github
-Atom (Text Editor)
-markdown language.

I don't know much about these things, but I am interested in learning new tools that will help me better understand.

I want to see how much I can progress this semester and hopefully will get good at this and design my own website! Woo!
